# NOTES

A computer can't read any file called ```.java``` but it can only read ```.class```.
It's the work of the compiler take the file and change it into what the computer can understand.

### Example:

    - ```javac jambo.java```
        This changes the java file into a class file as per how you named your class i.e 

        ```salamu.class```

    - ```java salamu```
        This is the command to run the java program


### TL;DR

Public meeans a method or class is public
Void means the method will run but not return anything

Arguements are any information the program needs to run

Void means a method returns nothing
String etc means a method returns a string
printf is a common print function in C but also used in Java

Constructor allows you to initialize a variable as soon as you create an object. 
However, the method name has to be the same as the class name.
