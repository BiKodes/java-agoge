# NOTES

A computer can't read any file called ```.java``` but it can only read ```.class```.
It's the work of the compiler take the file and change it into what the computer can understand.

### Example:

    - ```javac jambo.java```
        This changes the java file into a class file as per how you named your class i.e 

        ```salamu.class```

    - ```java salamu```
        This is the command to run the java program
